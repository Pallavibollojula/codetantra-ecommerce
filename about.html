      <p>Discover Ayurveda<br><br>
<p>The secrets to flawless skin and ageless beauty have been known to Indian physicians for over six thousand years, preserved in one of the world’s oldest systems of health care and healing, known as ‘Ayurveda’ or ‘Knowledge of Life’. Ayurveda works on four levels – body, breath, mind and spirit – it is only when all these are in perfect harmony that you radiate not only outer but also inner beauty.

    <h2>Three Faces of Beauty</h2>
    <p>When we determine someone's Prakriti or skin type, what we are actually doing is detecting which Dosha is most dominant in the person's constitution. First, the qualities of Absolute Beauty or poise, radiance, and vitality are the same in everyone; yet they express themselves through our different natures. One has the features of Vata; another, Pitta; and the third Kapha. They are simply different by design, and all perfect in their own right.</p>
